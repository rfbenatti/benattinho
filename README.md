- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @benattinho, a Environmental Engineering Double Degree student from University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) and Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST/ULisboa). Right now I'm currently on the beginning of my thesis, on ruptures detection of water distribution systems. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in water engineering, programming, building tools to be applied in people's lifes and running away from typical bureaucratic companies :) 

- I love playing my acoustic guitar (MPB/Bossa Nova fan) in my free time, reading and water sports. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Elixir and SQL, and already know Python.
